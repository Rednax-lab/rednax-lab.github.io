		<p>Trained by the award winning <a href="https://www.zonefacelift.com/">Ziggy Bergman</a>, I now also offer face reflexology. Facial reflexology, a technique that mirrors foot reflexology but is applied to the face, offers a plethora of benefits for overall well-being. Just like foot reflexology, facial reflexology can promote relaxation, improve sleep and improve mood. The practice is particularly effective in alleviating sinus issues, congestion, migraines and mental tensions, as it targets the facial muscles directly. By stimulating specific points on the face, this therapy can help release tension, improve circulation and enhance the bodyâ€™s natural healing abilities, contributing to a sense of calm and vitality.</p>
		<p>Additionally, facial reflexology can have a rejuvenating effect on the skin, leaving it looking radiant and glowing.</p>
		<h2>Zone Face lift treatment</h2>
		<p>This treatment combines hot towels, facial reflexology, Gua sha massage and ancient healing techniques. The Zone face lift has a cumulative effect and is most effective as part of a 12 week programme but a single treatment can still leave the skin feeling rejuvenated and naturally lift both the face and spirit. Here are some before and after pictures.</p>
