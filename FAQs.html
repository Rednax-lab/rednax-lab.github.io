		<h2>What is reflexology?</h2>
		<p>There is evidence of Reflexology being practiced in ancient civilizations such as Egypt, India and China and as far back as 4,000 B.C. The theory was then introduced to the West in the twentieth century. The principle of Reflexology is that there are reflex points on the hands and feet that correspond to all parts of the body. A therapist can restore and maintain the body's balance by gently applying pressure to these reflex points. Reflexology can encourage the release of toxins restoring and aiding the body's healing process.</p>
		<h2>What are the benefits of Reflexology?</h2>
		<p>Benefits of reflexology include increasing the blood and lymph flow, which encourages good circulation throughout the body and heart, meaning that every cell in the body benefits from the efficient distribution of nourishment and waste elimination. It also promotes a state of deep relaxation, relieving stress and tension, revitalising and leaving the client with a feeling of wellbeing.</p>
		<h2>What can I expect from a treatment?</h2>
		<p>Your first treatment will include a free consultation, where we can go through your individual needs. You will then be able to unwind on our comfortable couch. The treatment begins and ends with a relaxing foot massage. Reflexology treatment involves placing gentle but specific pressure on the many pressure points on the feet, toes and ankles. The treatment does not hurt and you should leave feeling thoroughly relaxed.</p>
