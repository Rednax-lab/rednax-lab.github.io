		<h1>You deserve more</h1>
		<p>I am a fully trained and insured foot and face Reflexologist based in the Carshalton/Wallington area, offering reflexology treatments, including supporting conception and maternity reflexology. Now offering the Zoneface lift treatment hailed in the <a href="https://www.zonefacelift.com/press">press</a> as a credible alternative to botox. If you would like to know more please get in touch.</p>
		<p>The principle of Reflexology is that there are reflex points on the face, hands and feet that correspond to all parts of the body. A Reflexologist can restore and maintain the body's balance by gently applying pressure to these reflex points. Reflexology can encourage the release of toxins restoring and aiding the body's healing process. Reflexology can be great at aiding sleep and promoting relaxation.</p>
